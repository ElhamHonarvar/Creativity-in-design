## About The Project

This project is all about innovation and problem-solving, particularly in tackling urgent challenges. Our case study delves into the realm of waste management, specifically focusing on smart sorting technologies. We kick off by embracing the concept of systems thinking, allowing us to explore novel ideas inspired by nature. We firmly believe that nature holds the key to many solutions, and our goal is to draw inspiration from its wisdom to create effective and sustainable solutions.
